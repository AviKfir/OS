FILES:
README
Makefile - a makefile.
graph.png - An image file with the graph of the results.
osm.cpp - The code for assignment 2.


ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
First the command 'mkdir' creates a new directory with the name - "Welcome",
then 'mkdir' command opens a sub-directory in "Welcome" that is called "To".
After that, the command 'openat' creates a file inside directory "To" with 
the name "OS2021".
Then with the command 'fstat' we get the status of this file 
(all the useful information related to the file).
Next the command 'write' writes into the file: "galb1997 If you haven't 
read the course guidlines yet --- do it now! 5" (5 - the argument we provided),
then the file closes with the command 'close'.
The command 'unlink' deletes the file and make the space it was using 
available for reuse. 
The command 'rmdir' removes the directory "To" and then again it removes the
directory "Welcome".
Finally the command - 'exit_group' exit all threads in a process.
