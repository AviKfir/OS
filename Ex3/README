FILES:
Makefile - Running make with no arguments should generate the
           libMapReduceFramework.a library.
README file - The README should be structured according to the course guidelines. In
              order to be compliant with the guidelines, please use the README template that we
              provided.
MapReduceFramework.cpp - The source files for our implementation of the library.
Barrier.cpp - the implementation of Barrier.h
Barrier.h - a synchronisation mechanism that makes sure no
            thread continues before all threads arrived at the barrier.

REMARKS:
The framework will support running a MapReduce operations as an asynchrony job, together with
ability to query the current state of a job while it is running.
